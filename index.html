            <h4>SkillCrush 104</h4>
            <p>My final 104 project was a weather app using the Rubygem Barometer. Check it out <a href="https://github.com/michelleisclever/weather-app">here</a>. The documentation left a lot to be desired and if you have a weather script built with Barometer you would like to share with me so I can learn, please connect with me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mmcmanus">LinkedIn</a> and share.</p>

            <h4>The catalyst</h4>

<p>After a very traumatic layoff from AIG, I found myself aggressively seeking a new job. I had been out of practice for 16 years since prior to working at AIG, I stayed with a company for nearly 11 years as we grew the company from a regional provider of transportation and warehousing to a global logistics entity. I started my career there as a temp and had worked my way up the ladder and did quite well, gaining valuable experience and connections along the way. </p>
            <p>One of those connections led me to my next adventure at AIG. The position came to me by way of referral. It was a really exciting opportunity to try something new and gain more experience. So I took it even though I was not looking for a job. Now, can you imagine what it felt like to find yourself so suddenly out of a job? Yes, I had many connections but unfortunately, because the layoff took a toll on 700+ people all once (and I'm told it was really more like 1800), my connections were mostly not in the right frame of mind to help a girl out. Additionally, I threw s much of my time and effort into expanding connections across the country that my connections here at home were a little dusty.</p>
            <h4>Adulting is hard</h4>
            <p>Then there was my family. As a single parent of two dependents, my burden was even greater. Now, I have a great boyfriend, but the keyword here is boyfriend. I am no stranger to hard times, either being I am a survivor of child abuse, domestic violence, extreme poverty and had been the sole financial provider for all of my children their entire life. I know I'm strong but still.</p>
            <h4>No time to wallow</h4>
            <p>I put my mind to solving the problem and while I actively started working all the angles, the contacts, listening to my coach and networking, I felt I needed to do something else which led me to plan b. Coding.</p>
            <p>For the last 16 years, I have had one foot in marketing and one foot in IT. I literally have done almost everything at one point in tme or another. From being a LAN administrator, a Microsoft Dynamics CRM administrator to applying tape to the edge of a stapled book to create a collateral piece. I had done it all! However, many of the job postings are very specific or too broad.</p>
            <p>Forutnately, I discovered <a href="http://www.skillcrush.com">SkillCrush</a>. There were so many other options but with the uncertainty of landing work soon, I had to take the most economical route. And so it goes that I enrolled in the Ruby on Rails blueprint.</p>
