<p>After a very traumatic layoff from AIG, I found myself aggressively seeking a new job. I had been out of practice for 16 years since prior to working at AIG, I stayed with a company for nearly 11 years as we grew the company from a regional provider of transportation and warehousing to a global logistics entity. I started my career there as a temp and had worked my way up the ladder and did quite well, gaining valuable experience. My next adventure came to me by way of referral so I was really not quite prepared to find myself suddenly without a paycheck and with a child in college and a child in high school... my anxiety level went through the roof. And while I actively started working all the angles, the contacts, listening to my coach and networking, I felt I needed to do something else which led me to plan b. Coding.</p>
            <p>Forutnately, I discovered <a href="http://www.skillcrush.com">SkillCrush</a>. There were so many other options but with the uncertainty of landing work soon, I had to take the most economical route. And so it goes that I enrolled in the Ruby on Rails blueprint.</p>
            <h3>SkillCrush</h3>

            <h3>SkillCrush 104</h3>
            <p>My final 104 project was a weather app using the Rubygem Barometer. Check it out <a href="https://github.com/michelleisclever/weather-app">here</a>. The documentation left a lot to be desired and if you have a weather script built with Barometer you would like to share with me so I can learn, please connect with me on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mmcmanus">LinkedIn</a> and share.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
